Answer the following questions. Be concise and clear
but explain carefully when needed.

NOTE: all are trained with 50 rounds

1 .- (1 marks) Train a 1-layer network using the Logistic activation
               function. (

	       Copy/paste the reported classification rates for:
	 	
	       Training data (last training round): 0.837138

	       Testing data: 0.850723

2 .- (1 marks) Repeat the process using the hyperbolic tangent activation
	       function.
	       
	       Training data (last training round): 0.881778

	       Testing data:0.884663

3 .- (1 marks) Which type of activation function yielded the best classification
	       results? which one learned faster?
	       
	       tanh have better final result also learn the fastet.
	       after first 5000 iteration the sigmoid only get 35% correct rate where tanh got 70 percent twice as much
	       

4 .- (1 marks) Train a 2-layer network with hyperbolic-tangent activation, using
	       150 hidden units. Report the classification rates on training and
	       testing data just as for 1) and 2).	       
	       
	       Training data (last training round): 0.847840

	       Testing data: 0.858443
	       
5 .- (1 marks) Same as 4), except use 10 hidden units instead

	       Training data (last training round): 0.835273
	       
	       Testing data: 0.839038

6 .- (1 marks) Same as 5), except use 3 hidden units instead

	       Training data (last training round): 0.390826

	       Testing data: 0.386937

7 .- (4 marks) Comment on the experiments in 4, 5, and 6, and give your conclusion
	       regarding the effect of the number of hidden units on classification
	       accuracy. 

         3 is really terrible for the reason below.
         10 and 150 hidden nerons are not making significant difference. It only differes by 2%.
         Increasing the number of node on a single layer will significant increase training time with only minor improvement.
         
	       What is the network with 3 hidden telling you about this classification
	       problem?
	       
	       with only 3 hidden node we don't have eough pattarn (we only have 2^3 = 8 overall) for the classifire to classify.
	       
	       That is why the rate is super low.

8 .- (5 marks) Train the best performing network you can. Use any activation function
	       you wish, and set the number of hidden units so as to achieve the best
	       performance.

	       Number of hidden units used: 150

	       Classification rate on testing data: 0.858443

9 .- (5 marks) Describe how you would build a network to play the cat
	        and mouse game (move the mouse to help it survive).

		- Describe what the input is in terms of a vector of
		  values
		      each cell of maze will be a input node. 
		         empty here the value will be 0
		         mouse there will be 1
		         chese will be 0.75
		         cat there will be 0.25
		- Describe what the output layer looks like (how many
		  neurons and what they encode)
		      4 output as the mouse suppose to move up left down right
		- Describe the error function
		      We will use some feature to evaluate current states
		- How many layers should you use?
		      4 - 5

working partially, briefly describe what works, what
doesn't work, or what problems exist.
